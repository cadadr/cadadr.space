                                  ⁂

These two pieces are from the late spring of 2019.  I might’ve published the first one on tildes.net in the past.

## Pins and needles

```
Pins and needles
in my left leg.
As I minimally move
they acute and grave.
I sleep, I shall wake up;
what will it have been:
a circumflex, or an umlaut?
```

## I know nothing

```
I know nothing
nor do I want to:
a blank brain
is all I want!

I have nothing
nor do I want to:
I want to be,
nothing else do I want!
```
