                                  ⁂

It’s been about a month since my last post on this gemlog.  I would love to be able to honestly say that’s because I’ve been reading like there’s no tomorrow and hit the target amount of reading or even went above, but nopes.  It’s been part existential dread and pure boredom driven procrastination, a large part, and then some concrete work.  Productive tho, luckily.

I have noticed something.  Spaces are very important to one’s work.  This has been the main challenge for me during the past month.  Since I moved back in with my parents more than a year ago, in that dreaded March of that awful year, I’ve been mostly living in this little childhood room of mine.  It’s neither large nor small.  I’ve got abundant shelves, my bed, couple armchairs, and a desk.  I built myself a desktop computer for the first time in ages.  It was a whole thing to stop being a laptop only person.  Call me ridiculous but this kinda feels like a marriage: something that you have to consider when travelling, moving, etc.  And it’s not a roommate, can’t just say «bye!» and go.  But I digress.  I’ve been living in this space, and mostly sitting on my chair in front of my computer.  The computer is where all of boredom, work, and entertainment happens.  This makes everything very difficult, because everything bleeds into each other.  Distractions are one click away.  Things break and distract, but not as much.  The simple fact is that it’s _incredibly_ easy for me hit F3 to go to the workspace my browser is in, navigate to Mastodon or Reddit or YouTube, or whatnot, and without ever noticing, more than a couple hours are gone.

Even worse, at that point I find myself in this ‘gratification’ or ‘binge-procrastination’ modality of operation: stopping binging on internet fluff and starting work becomes this... effort.  There’s this tension I need to travail against, I find, to break from one and move on to another.  And it doesn’t happen at once.  My sleep also being broken, I find myself starting to read at the end of the evening, with maybe a couple or so ours of proper attention remaining, plus with this feeling of guilt and self-pity and anger and remorse combined, which also eats into my productivity by the way of reducing my enthusiasm.

Now, one may wonder, don’t you think maybe this whole thing is not for you, Göktuğ?  Maybe you just don’t want to nor enjoy doing this?  And I kid you not I’ve asked these to myself a billion times over the last month.  And the thing is, with full and sincere honesty to myself, I know that this *is* for me and that I *do* want do and *do* enjoy doing this whole thing.  Why, then, the desire to do what I enjoy doesn’t overcome the attraction towards procrastination and instant gratification, is a question that’s interesting and one that I have not the answer for.

I have recently watched a video [*].  Not much in there that’s revolutionary, but one of Julia’s advices I’m currently trying.  And that is: start work as soon as you wake up.  Do not begin your day with social media.  Do not browse the news, read the feeds, glimpse the vids, skim the mail, etc.  For the last week an a half, I’ve tried to stick to this algorithm: Wake up.  Do bullet journal shit [1].  Grab earphones and the phone.  Start podcast episode [†].  Brew 500 to 600ml of coffee.  Turn computer on (i.e. resume from hibernate).  Reset Pomodoro timer and start timer in ease-in mode [‡].  Start reading.

Every day that I’ve strictly stuck to this plan has been very productive.  I think this supports the idea that same space being used for multiple conflicting things is bad.  If I sit down at my work area and start social-media-ing, that space is contaminated.  It takes effort to decontaminate that space.  An extreme measure is to rid of social media, but thing is, it is helpful and nice.  Being on Mastodon, for example, has been a sanity boost throughout the pandemic.  It’s also taught me a lot.  Reddit is a cesspool, one might say, but there are subreddits that are great.  r/GradSchool can fill up with “I’m done I’m dropping out” posts, accounts of abuse, and sometimes toxicity, but OTOH it’s helpful in reminding that you’re not alone in shit that you encounter in grad school, whether pandemic related or not.  r/badlinguistics can give you some great laughs.  It’s nice to go to r/Workspaces or r/AverageBattlestations and browse people’s spaces.  Subs like r/emacs [2] and r/orgmode are actually useful.  But there’s a lot of it and it needs moderating, and failure at that’s what causes all the trouble.  I’m the kind of person that’s too vulnerable to getting distracted.  Contaminating my workspace thus is something that I should avoid.

This reminds me of a video CGP Grey published early during the pandemic [*] about having different physical spaces for different activities.  And, IMHO, just like the utterly broken clock that, besides being utterly broken, also lacks a seconds and a minutes hand, shows the correct time once a day, in this video Mr. Acronym McStickfigure happens to make a good point.  This computer I’m typing this post on being the one Location for everything I do is troublesome.  For example, I am logged in to Mastodon and Reddit on the browser.  It’s way too easy for me to just browse for a little moment, which of course _never is_ just a little moment.  And when I’m not working and specifically just browsing around, it’s inevitable that this space, this square metre of space, become associated with or at least enabling for that sort of activity.

I have come to think about this spaces idea thanks to a realisation regarding, of all things, physical spaces (holy hell, I’m a master of plot twists, you wouldn’t ever expect that, would you).  More precisely, the library and the café.  And the ‘vapur’.  In ye olde times of September 2019 thru March 2020, when I wasn’t home I was at the library.  With my laptop, sitting and studenting.  And it was productive.  If you ask me, hey Göko, what did you do between September 2018 and June 2019, I’d say I was home studying, but the fact is, I was often, not always, but often, either at a café or on the ‘vapurs’ of Istanbul—large-ish boats that dart between the docks of the Bosporus and of the Marmara coasts of Istanbul, with large indoor spaces, some of the seats with tables, and always with a little cafeteria [3]—with my books, my laptop, my bullet journal, my A5 clipboard, music in my earphones, doing my work.  I didn’t need anything special.  I left home to get to a space and for a purpose, and did my thing.  The recent realisation is that, this has completely gone from my life, and this is part of what makes me miserable.  I’m simply stuck between these four walls.  I could go study outside still, but it’s not at all the same thing.  There are less people out, but it’s more distracting, given especially the fact that cases are soaring in Turkey.  All these spaces are threatening now, and all these spaces you use per your needs, not wishes.  It would not only be risky for me to sail around every day, it’d be irresponsible as a citizen to spend hours on end on public transport when I don’t at all _have_ to.

So I’ve been home for ages, looking at this screen, and doing everything through it.  Plus the little phone screen of course.  More than the lack of space at home, constantly being at home has made this a huge expanse of unproductivity and alienation for me.  I don’t have the library, I no longer have the vapur ride, I no longer enjoy cafés.

Now that I think of it, maybe I could make little spaces around the home and the garden, given especially we’re slowly (too slowly, this year, because fuck shit why not, bloody climate) heading into the nicer part of spring.

But in any case I like this ‘realisation’, and I mainly wanted to share it.  It sometimes does take me a lot of logorrhoea to make a drop of sense maybe, but what’s the point of a story without the story.  I could’ve tooted a... shyte, professionally posted a post on the topic instead (I toot, m’kay).

So there’s that, and this here is a conclusion.  I gotta wake up early tomorrow for a meeting with my advisor so that she doesn’t forget I’m (mostly) alive.  Catch you later, night night!

[1] «bullet journal shit» meaning: cross out yesterday and write down today’s tasks.  Why I’ve gone back to bullet journaling, leaving my lovely Org mode agenda, is probably a topic for a later c.s/blag entry.

[2] The mod team of r/emacs recently recruited a gun ownership advocate, which is why I’ve stopped reading and contributing to that subreddit.

[3] If you ate at one of these before and was disgusted by the shit food, good news: it’s way better now that the municipality’s been liberated from Erdo bois.  Post covid, retry.
