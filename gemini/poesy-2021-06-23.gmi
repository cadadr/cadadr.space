                                  ⁂

This is a recent one.  It is one that kinda confuses me too. I don't really know if I have been able to express what I want to express, because I feel like the gendered language of the poem obfuscates the sense I wish to create.  But also, the gendered relation imparts the expressive force of the father-daughter relationship, both in its constructive and positive myth and in its often destructive and negative reality that's so prevalent.  I tought a lot about whether I should or should not excise it from the piece, but whenever I attempted removing it, it felt like the result would betray the gendered, destructive reality I wished it to express, and whenever I decided to keep it, it felt like the poem communicated a grandiose, lauding illustration of patriarchy.  Maybe this is thus a failed poem that sounds good, but yet communicatively and artistically stillborn, as it warrants a disclaimer like this for it to be understood as intended.

There of course is a third possibility: that I am a bit paranoid that it may be misunderstood and thus am trying to prime the reader's interpretation a certain way before they even lay their eyes on the verse.

Maybe I'm a tracherous poet, but I still hope you enjoy this one.

## My little girl

```
My little girl
i am man
all this built i
thus product

Of dust ocean fire
i am none

---as below
   so below---
---none other than
   fire me consumes---
can you tell
can you tell

My little girl
i am ire
ravaging the land’s
fumbling lair

In there
where you be
sailingly ships disappear
into ignorable horizons
lost my core wimbles
tunnels into my days openingly

---as above
   so above---

My palm puttingly on my chest
i see
my heart verminates
evil swarms
and see i not
for with weapons of mass prestriction
hit am i

Melancholiac little sightlessnesses
m’encrust brittlishly
```
