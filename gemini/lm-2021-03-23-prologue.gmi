The most pseudo-productive way of procrastinating is to talk meta on what you’re supposed to be doing now, so, here I am.  The purpose of this post is to kick off a journal on my master’s adventure.  In this post I’ll summarise the first two years of the process, and in subsequent posts I’ll mostly be talking about what I read since the last post.  At some point I’ll progress onto doing the experiments, working with the data, and writing the thesis, and along this process the content of this gemlog will adapt.  I’m supposed to complete my studies by early 2022, at which time this gemlog will also come to a conclusion (oh, don’t worry, I’ll then begin a PhD and heavens forbid I shall ever STFU about it).

My master’s adventure began when I completed my bachelor’s in Italianistics, of all possible undergrad degrees a young Turkish boy would fancy, who surprisingly hadn’t even had pizza in his life before signing up for that degree.  It’s an unnecessary tangential to this absolutely important must read piece of text, so I’ll skip the why and how of that weird event.  Suffice it to say that, thanks to circumstances unclear to me, I managed to complete my degree in the four years the powers that be hath allotted unto I, and as I graduated I was pretty intrigued with Comparative Literature, and wanted to do a master’s in that discipline.

I was interested in how nations, Turkey in particular, were constructed.  This was an issue that was initially very important to me, as I was being tormented with an identity crisis in the years that lead up to my graduation, in the June of 2018.  Studying the past of Turkey, of the Ottoman Empire, and of the (Eastern) Mediterranean, I had discovered the lies, the crimes, the cover-ups the Turkish identity of mine was built upon.  This later had turned into an amateurial research endeavour into the concept of Nation.  I learned that Nation was a Social Construct, and a particularly harmful one.  I learned the patterns in the formation and change of nationhood and national identity, and the history of the concept of Nation and nationalism itself.  I discovered ideas like Renfrew’s ‘elite dominance’ [1], for instance, and towards the summer of 2018 I was reading about ‘Imagology’, and was particularly interested in the work of the likes of Joep Leerssen.  My aim was to deconstruct Turkish identity through the gaze of Europe throughout the second millennium, in order to trace the process of the production of the Turkish national identity I was born into.  My ‘noble’ final goal was to deconstruct and destroy the concept of Nation, and prove that it was entirely a human construct, and that there was no merit, be it biological, historical or logical, to the concepts of Nation, Ethnicity, Race, and the rest of the usual cohort.  But there was a problem.

The problem, as I discovered in that beautiful summer, was that there was no research work to do, and nothing to prove.  It was already obvious to those who were willing to think and understand, that indeed all these were human constructs, social constructs, and useless and harmful ones at that.  That all people were one and that all our misery was self inflicted was, a fact, not a debate.  All I could do would’ve been to regurgitate the old literature, find the same findings that others found, maybe through different paths.  And that would’ve been dishonest, and I couldn’t spend my life pretending to say a new thing when all I did was to say what my colleagues said, but in different words, paraphrasing enough so that I could go under the radar of a plagiarism check.

Or so I thought.  I had fallen into the age-old trap of going into research with an end goal in mind.  It was not clear to me that research in itself is interesting and beautiful.  I wanted my findings to be important and useful beyond their intrinsic scholarly value.  In hindsight this was deeply wrong, and in hindsight even if the findings would inevitably mostly fall onto deaf ears, these projects were beautiful in and off of themselves, and they are useful to the study of the literature and of the culture of Turkey, of Middle East, of the Ottoman Empire, and of nation and literary representation in general.  I don’t mourn my decision, I love Linguistics.  But I really hope that someone else is eventually interested in doing this research, as especially the early Turkish period of Anatolia is obscure, and the representation of the ‘Turk’ in European literature is ripe and overflowing with a lot of interesting stuff to discover.

Despite my ‘discovery’, I proceeded, at the end of that summer, to apply to the Comparative Literature master’s programme at the Eskişehir Osman Gazi University.  I had forgotten about my discovery, as I was oblivious to the realities of life thanks to the excitement that I was applying for a master’s programme, and realising my dreams, present since my childhood, of becoming a researcher, an academic.  Well, not quite, of course, but it was the first step, no?  But there was a problem.

This time a concrete problem: I had to either document my knowledge of two languages, or take a preparatory year and learn one of Arabic, French, German, Persian, and IIRC maybe also Russian.  The prep year would be costly, and while I knew Italian, I had no document to prove it, and my BA diploma in Italianistics would not count.  The nearest available date for a recognised language test was a few months in the future.  So, I thought to myself, rather than going through a year of prep classes, I could just stay in Istanbul, work and save some moneh, and maybe even learn one of them languages, even, as the French consulate in Istanbul had courses.  Thus, I decided to put my applications off for one year, and start looking for work.  Buuuuutt, there was a problem.

Immediately after this, my ‘discovery’ came to haunt me, and I quickly lost any interest in Comparatistics, as the ecstasy of the master’s applications faded away.  I knew I wanted to become a researcher, and I knew I didn’t want anything else, and thus came a month of Soul Searching in Great Anguish and Goliardic Pain of Existential Crisis.  It was literally the longest, most depressed, most stressful month of my life.  I had to reorient myself in the world of academia, and find a new discipline to express my passion and curiosity in.

I had options.  I could go back to Literature, I could study sociology, I could go into philosophy.  About this time I got a mail from a PhD in Ireland who had read a blog post of mine [*] that I had published earlier that year, documenting the seeds of confusions that I were now being tormented by.  He said he could relate, and he had found a home for himself in IIRC «Science and Technology Studies», [†] a field that combined technology, natural and formal sciences, and social sciences in order to observe how the two affected each other, and the field had a lot of applied specialisations, e.g. in city planning, which is one of those disciplines I’d love to go into if I had a spare life.  All of these were intriguing, but at the end of this process, I rediscovered a passion for Linguistics.

A passion for Linguistics is not something that comes out of nothing.  I had become interested in the history of language before my university years, as I was slowly drawn away from software development into literature and philosophy, and discovering information and history that eventually got me into comparative literature.  I was absorbing information about language families, language change, and other popular linguistics topics.  But that passion faded away when I began my undergrad studies, tho the knowledge of course stayed.

At the end of The Month, I discovered I could ‘port’ my Comparatistics questions onto Diachronic Linguistics: I could study the adstratal makeup of Turkish, which could totally constitute another window into the history and Turkification of Asia Minor.  So, one September or November day, the decision was made: I’d do a master’s in Linguistics.  But, there was a problem.

I didn’t know much linguistics beyond language families and outdated structuralism you learn as a BA in Literature.  So, I had to study.  And study I did, until the July of 2019.  There’s a blog post that documents the process [*], which I won’t repeat here, but if you’re ‘converting’ to Linguistics, I do suggest you give it a read because I have some nice books and MOOCs referenced in there.  Suffice it to say, I applied to four universities, got accepted into two, and come the end of Summer 2019, I was registering at the Institute for Social Sciences of Hacettepe University.  I moved to a shitty flat in Ankara, where I stayed until The Shit Hit Teh Fan in the March of 2020.  I’ve been in Istanbul ever since.

As I prepared for the qualifications, and as I studied throughout the first semester of the programme, I slowly swayed away from my initial plans of studying the strata of Modern Standard Turkish, and grew interest in Phonology, Usage Based Grammars (mainly Construction Grammar), and Sociolinguistics in it’s synchronic, variationist form.  I had also grown an interest in learning about Open Science related ideology and activism, and in teaching and application of computing in Social Sciences.  I felt grounded, and confident.  I felt at home.  I felt honest to myself and captivated by the topics of research themselves, and not merely by a quixotic drive of proving this or destroying that, which is by definition unscientific and fugacious.

I postponed Spring 2020, and once I was able to get over the psychological impact of the New Normal, I decided to study statistics, which I did very slowly, in the short stretches of time I stole from repressing my horror and anguish through countless hours of playing Mount&Blade Bannerlord’s early access release.  I read a book by Urdan [2] and half-read one by Navarro [3] (which I am to complete during my current master’s readings), and completed my courses eventually in January 2021.  Picking a thesis topic was a bit of a labour given my goat track of an higher education so far, but I was smart enough to make a notebook [*] of my research ideas throughout the last two years, and after a couple weeks of studying it, I came up with a topic for my thesis research: word stress in Turkish.  It’s an area where theories abound but experimentation is lacking, and my thesis is basically a comparative analysis and test of existing approaches, the outcome of which will be either generating evidence in favour of one or more of prior theories, or maybe the creation of a new theory informed by earlier findings.

[*] Actually, an Org mode file, wink wink

So, where am I at now?  I’ve found close to a hundred papers and books, which I need to have read by the end of June 2021.  I’ve been mostly procrastinating throughout March, slowly reading my first book, tho part of the reason is the landlady of my flat in Ankara making the process of vacating it into a torment, the selfish, greedy, lazy asshole.  I wish I knew, I’d never pay my rent a week or two in advance like I did, and be a dick about every little problem the flat continuously caused me, like an awful fly infestation, which I fixed by myself.  But lesson learned, never show mercy and friendliness to the bourgeois leeches that own and rent property again.  But thankfully that’s almost come to an end, and the only half legitimate excuse to procrastinate now is to write my uninteresting little autobiography that you’ve read till the end, for some reason.  Maybe you were curious, maybe you’re going through or did go through similar troubles, or maybe you’re interested in research and want to do a master’s; whatever the reason, please know that, I really appreciate that my little story of A Giant Step for Me but Not Even A Lilliputian Step for Humankind resonated with you, and you found it worth reading.
