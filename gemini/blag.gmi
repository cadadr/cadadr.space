# Göktuğ’s Blaggings

## A gemlog from cadadr.space

‘cadadr.space/blag’ is the last iteration of my blog [1, 2], in the form of a Gem[ini b]log.  After some blogging first with Hakyll [3, 4] and then Dreamwidth [1], I felt the need for something lighter and simpler, so I decided to give Gemini a shot.  Some of the content below is copied over from my gopherhole on SDF [5], and I’ve linked to some interesting stuff from older blogs.
