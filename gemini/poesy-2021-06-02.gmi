                                  ⁂

This poem is from June 2019.  I do have a backlog of unpublished poetry, tho only a small part of it is in English, so if I stick to English language stuff in this gemlog, posts may slow down a bit soon.  I’ve this bursts of productivity when it comes to poetry: for a few months every couple years I’ll just write many, and then it’s down to one or two every couple months. The last couple years have been the downtime so far, guess because the grad school is taking a lot of mental space.  By the way, for poetry in other languages, I do feel like publishing them too, but I’ll probably start a separate gemlog for it (will probably be announced on this one and on c.s/blag if/when that happens).

Anyways, this one is the kind of poem that may not make sense if you only read it linearly/literally.  I’ll say it has a way of communicating the layering to you, and leave spoilers at that.  Please enjoy the verses!

## Mother of day, sister of dusk

```
set sail
in green sea
sky whispering
from northeast
«this water embraced
many young bodies
gave them what was
their last cuddle»
set sail
along shore
in the golden hour
soon the day will cease to be
set sail
some time ago
some hours ago or some centuries
sky blabbering
«it is not vortices
that swallow ships»
browse in some direction
---all the same
in the dark---
electric lights wink and wiggle
«all they do is
bite and chew»
sails tremble and whip
wind comes from there now
then from over here
adjust to make textile yawn
whip and wake up
like a wave against a mole
«sea is a big stomach
it shall swallow and digest
everything one day» sure
there are motors in this ship
but let wind decide
let the sea decide
«the sea is the vortex
it pulled you away from the land
it is the abyss atop which you float
and into which you will go»
I have no fear, none
I’m not afraid of ghosts
I’m not afraid of the djinni
I’m not afraid of leaves
I’m not afraid of cats
«I’m not afraid of life
as death is far away»
set sail «sing a chill wind»
rub along this farm of bubbles
green sea in dark «night
mother of day
sister of dusk»
lights tremble and flock away
«shall encircle you» as stars appear
«and the night shall swallow you»
and the night does swallow me
```
