                                  ⁂

This one was written within the last few days as I walked back home.  I tend to not edit poems a lot, but this one did see some editing before I posted.

Sometimes a poem is built as a set of feelings and/or evocative scenes that go well together, and I have the overal feeling I wish to put into words, but for a meaning to take shape, I have to go over them again and discover it myself, before I can finalise a piece.

A poem of this abstract sort is of course inherently polysemous, when it comes to a literal and even an abstract and/or allegorical reading. Maybe what can be more unambiguously communicated is is the way of perceiving the world that is imbued in the poem, sourced in the author's gaze itself of course, which is maybe the main thing a non-realist poem can share at an "objective" level, whatever that may mean.

But in any case, ambiguity is beautiful, and I love ambiguity. Ambiguity is inherent in our lives, and trying to escape it is futile. We must embrace it as a source of knowledge and as a building block of understanding. Accept that there's entropy inherent in sensation and in information, and analyse the world with that in mind.

Oh whoops I'm sliding into philosophy of science. Let's cut to the star of the show itself, enjoy this terribly titled poem:

## Emphasis

```
Walks
a goat on cliffs
she

---what's almost there
   isn't
   isn't it---

What
counts as numbers
go up
when
hers are the cliffs
the goats goat on

What's
What'sn't
When
she's so permanent

---all we are is but a
   pleasant breeze on her face---

I must emphasise
all is a yes or no question

Is she

We will
till when
```
