So the traditional way of furnishing a room in Turkey was such that you'd have a "sedir" or a "divan" along one or two walls. Sedir is a long, often L shaped sofa, with intermittent armrests, or none. Divan is when a mattress is laid along the walls, with cushions to lean against (and sedir is essentially a raised divan). You sit on this stuff cross-legged. In modern homes this is often replaced with normal sofas and armchairs arranged like a divan, along the walls. The generation of my parents and their parents really fancy sofa beds, as the "guest" is king. So you'll often see a couple sofa beds and a couple single arm chair beds in such arrangements.

Food would be eaten on the ground. This is more common in the East these days, but some urban emigrants still do it. E.g., whenever we'd go to visit my dad's mom's, we'd eat on the floor. The floor always has rugs, of course, and you may never go in the house with shoes on and without slippers. We have these round, wooden tables that could seat ~10 people side by side, with a cross shaped leg to sit on. You put a large table cloth to cover it al, and then a large "sini", which is a large round metal tray, often of similar dimensions to the table itself. Some plates are shared, some plates are per person. It's like the Japansese chabudai, but larger, and the legs are in the middle to allow comfortable seating. You sit cross legged or on your knees around it.

As for beds, we had something similar to Japanese futons, called "yer yatağı", "floor bed". It's basically a matress, pillows, and a quilt/blanket (traditional Turkish pillows and quilts are incredibly comfortable, I wish I could find our old ones...) Sometimes, for the kids or parents, you'd have a single large floor bed with long pillows and quilts.

I don't exactly know what a study would look like, but I do know that a "rahle" was used for reading, which is a wide X shaped contraption, made of wood, that could host a book. Don't know much of the writing setup. More modern-traditional way would be to sit on the ground with a "sehpa" tho. A sehpa is a sort of coffee table, and usually it's a set of 3-4 of them that go under one another when not used. the largest one is big enough to receive a couple plates, a bowl, and a glass, smallest one is often good enough for a single plate. These generally are tall enough to be level with a sedir or a sofa. You'd be seated on the floor and studying on one of the *sehpa*s.

IIUC a lot of this is similar to Japanese ways, and a lot of this is, or more like used to be, shared around the eastern mediterranean and western asia.

The point I wish to get to is, this "modern" style of furniture is static. Table is one large thing, along with its chairs. Table is not going anywhere. The bed is large af, and the bed is going anywhere. The desk is huge af and it isn't going anywhere either.

But with these "older" ways, if you're not eating anything, the floor table and the sini are laid against a wall in the kitchen or in the back room. You only have as many beds as you need, and you can easily roll it up and tuck it away if need be. Sehpas sit beside the sofas or the sedir, covering only as large a volume as the largest one. Sofas or the sedir are at the edges of the room so all the space in the centre is free.

This means, (i) you need less space, (ii) less shit is lying around at any given time, (iii) almost all of the space can be easily sweeped or hoovered easily without any acrobatics, (iv) way less wood needs cutting to furnish the whole house, and (v) it's good for your butt, you can sit down for ages but you can't sit cross-legged or kneel in the same position for 30 min straight.

All in all, I'm coming to the realisation that, it's a superior use of space than having Huge Ass Immovable Shit in every room. Here we think of it as old and archaic and backwards (as we do with a lot of things in Turkey), but IMHO owning shit you don't need which constantly occupies all your space is what is backwards. I have a huge bookshelf in this room, half filled with books I read and those I bought but didn't read. They could instead occupy a few kilobytes if it was a list of books I took from the library before, and a list of books I plan to take, plus a couple that I have checked out. If I hadn't had a large ass single bed here but a floor bed, I could easily excercise in this room. If I hadn't had the desktop computer but a good laptop, I wouldn't need this entire desk, or at least the computer and its shit wouldn't occupy the whole space. I wouldn't need this stupid swiveling chair if I sat on my natural chair, which is my butt, putting it on the floor.

Going back to the title, I think dynamic space where you can easily add / remove the furniture is superior to furniture that requires dedicated space, in the ways I list in my last two paragraphs. There are of course exceptions for different types of spaces (e.g. an atelier cannot productively be a fully 'dynamic' space) and these traditional ways should be combined with modern improvements and with orthopedic considerations and the effects of disabilities in mind, but the gist of it is, I guess, making our spaces more dynamic could be a goal worth pursuing.
