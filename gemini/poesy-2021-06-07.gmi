This one is only a week old.  Feels to me like it’s not in its perfect form, but also my attempts to modify it have failed, so it leaves the cave for the sunlight just like how it was born.

## Nestles in sorrow a good day

```
Nestles in sorrow a good day
as leaves in wind swimmingly weep
narrow bridges connecting me to day
dance to their destruction

Common soldiers of poor tune
sing songs soon forgotten
untold remains the putrid feast
of birds of long-killed prey
```
