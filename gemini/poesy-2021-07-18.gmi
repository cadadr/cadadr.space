                                  ⁂

These two poems, as the title says, are some of my earliest English poems that I have recorded.  They are from early 2018.

The second one has some potentially screenreader-unfriendly play, which I’ll explain at the end of the page. Enjoy!

## From behind a door

```the poem
From behind a door
I imagine you will arrive
with that peace-bearing air to you.
I will immerse myself
in the words you'll keep to yourself
while mouths are dripping warm sounds
for nothing else than sharing a moment.
I imagine your embrace
which will lighten the dense awe of being.
I imagine you leaking
into all my cracks and voids
filling that absence of you in me
which I had since
time immemorial.
I long for a past which never happened
where I always imagine you present
saving me lovingly from
the to-days I everyday resent.
```

## And as Night sails along

```the poem
And as Night sails along
as the patron of all Formation
as the patron of all those
who presume to be Creation
as the Gods with hazy eyelids
which put them to Dormition
o her Name Merciful's soave bosom
where the Holy sleep, where the
holy Sleep guards them and us
as she travels aboard the Mother's ship
as every Star would notice
the blinding Splendor
as Night sails along
as the Holy sleep the holy Sleep.
```

                                  ⁂

The screenreader-unfriendly play here is that in the first occurrence of the phrase "holy sleep", "holy" starts with a capital letter, whereas in the second instance in the following verse, the word "sleep" starts with a capital letter. The same pattern repeats in the last verse. Also, words Night, Formation, Creation, Dormition, Mother, Star and Splendor are extraordinarily capitalised.
